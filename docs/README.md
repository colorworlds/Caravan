Caravan is a Multiplayer RTS Base-Racer developed in Godot engine. Set in an alternate dark ages where frogs — rather than apes — evolved intelligence. Players build castles on the backs of camels and race them to the next market along the Silk Road.

There are several central innovations that make Caravan unique. A drafting system allows racers to conserve energy while drafting other player's camel. A "Portends" system gives players the ability to populate (represented as precognition) the race with antagonists, storms, and resource caches through prayer. Caravan is rendered in a 2D side-scrolling format where players can pass through each other (or overlap) but a crowding system manages their ability to do so without crashing. A health and endurance system based on alchemy and humoural theory models the complex task of keeping a camel and its frog crew marking along the Silk Road.
